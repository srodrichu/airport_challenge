## Describe the Problem

Put or write the user story here. Addd any clarifying notes you might have.

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination

## Design the Method Signature

Include the name of the method, it's parameters, return value, and side effects.

```ruby

```

## Create Examples as Integration Tests

Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.


```ruby
# 1

```

## Create Examples as Unit Tests

Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail.

```ruby
# 1

```

## Implement the Behaviour

After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour
